# Zomato Sales Analysis Using Python

## Overview
Understanding customer preferences and restaurant trends is crucial for making informed business decisions in the food industry.  
This project performs an exploratory analysis of the **Zomato Restaurant Dataset** using Python to uncover meaningful insights about
restaurant types, ordering modes, pricing preferences, and customer ratings.

## Objectives
The analysis focuses on answering key business questions:
- Do more restaurants provide online delivery compared to offline services?
- Which types of restaurants are most favored by the general public?
- What price range do couples prefer for dining out?
- How do ratings differ between online and offline orders?

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values, standardized column names, and removed outliers for accurate analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Used Python libraries such as **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn** to perform grouping, aggregation, and visualization.
3. **Visualization**  
   - Bar charts, count plots, and pie charts were created to clearly communicate patterns in restaurant types, pricing, and ratings.

## Key Insights
- **Restaurant Type**: The majority of restaurants fall into the **Dining** category, which is preferred by a larger number of individuals.
- **Online vs Offline Orders**: Dining restaurants primarily accept **offline orders**, whereas **Cafés** are more likely to receive online orders.
- **Price Range for Couples**: Couples generally prefer restaurants with an approximate cost of **₹300** for two.
- **Ratings**: Offline orders tend to receive **lower ratings** compared to online orders, which often obtain excellent ratings.

## Conclusion
The findings suggest that while customers still enjoy in-person dining experiences, there is a growing trust and satisfaction with online ordering—particularly in café-style establishments.  
Dining restaurants remain the dominant choice for customers, but the strong performance of online ratings indicates that digital ordering platforms will continue to play an important role in shaping the future of the food industry.
